# Customer-Churn

### Customer churn is the phenomenon in which a client stops doing business with an entity. Users can stop using a company’s product or service for a variety of reasons, such as affordability, dissatisfaction with the offering, and bad customer service.

### More often than not, customers who churn from one company will start doing business with their competitor. For instance, if you aren’t happy with your current mobile service provider due to slow Internet speed, you are likely to switch to an alternative.

### The act of churning isn’t one that happens suddenly. If you experience low network bandwidth, you are likely to tolerate it for a month or two. During this period, you would probably contact customer support, check your network speed, and leave a review on social media expressing your dissatisfaction.

### For subscription-based companies like Netflix and Spotify, it is crucial to retain existing customers since the entire business model relies on plan renewals.
